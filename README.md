Problem Overview: 

In 2015, there were an estimated 253 million people with visual impairment worldwide. With the world racing towards an era of complete digitalization, a technological advancement that heavily relies on screen based visual outputs, it is time we notice that a lot of people would not be able to reap the complete benefits of this societal change.

Since web experiences are inherently visual, the web is fraught with sites, tools, and apps that are practically unusable for people with visual impairments. It is a known fact that people need to use the web every day to surf, read and write emails, and to do anything else anyone can conceivably do on the internet. Users with visual impairments should not have to adapt their behavior in order to accomplish their goals effectively. Rather, we need to develop tools that should accommodate the needs of all users, including people with visual impairments.

Over the years there has been considerable development to solve these problems. Screen readers are the most popular tool in this domain, and accessibility tools are adapted according to the potential use of a screen reader. Today, developers are advised to provide text hierarchy, pictures now need to have descriptive alternative texts that can be interpreted by the screen reader, websites are structured to ensure they are easily readable and surfable.

The most common problems with the current accessibility tools arise with inaccurate picture descriptions, interpretation and summarization of further links of these links and decision making while navigating websites.

Our project attempts to bridge this gap by helping those with visual impairment access this information in a manner which is convenient to them. Our project encompasses a chrome extension which allows the user to input their form of disability, be it colour blindness, hypermetropia or incomplete visibility. It focuses on improving the readability and navigation of webpage from the perspective of a screen reader.

Scope of the project:

●	Allows users with colour blindness to choose their respective category of colour blindness and instantly makes respective changes to the webpage in terms of colour contrast and visibility to make it better accessible for the user.

●	A feature for users to be able zoom into a particular part of the webpage without increasing the size of the entire webpage, allowing them to clearly read the part they may be hovering over without distorting their view of the entire page.

●	Another feature of simply creating a summary of the entire web page and displaying it on a separate tab, where the summary is conveyed to the user through speech synthesis allowing them to access this information in a compact manner without having the hassle of reading the entire text, by simply being able to hear it. The user will have the ability to play, pause, restart and even change the dictation speed according to their convenience.
